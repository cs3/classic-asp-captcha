CAPTCHA (an acronym for "completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart", trademarked by Carnegie Mellon University) is a type of challenge-response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human. 

ASP Captcha Project was implemented in ASP scripting language and was the first of its kind in its language.
